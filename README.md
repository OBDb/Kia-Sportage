## Generations

The Kia Sportage has evolved through five distinct generations, transitioning from a rugged compact SUV to a modern crossover with advanced technology and hybrid options:

- **First Generation (1993-2002)**: The first-generation Kia Sportage was developed with a Mazda Bongo engineering base platform. It shares many mechanical components such as the engine, transmissions (early versions), and differentials with the Mazda line of vehicles. This was during Kia's alliance with Ford and Mazda, which involved Ford/Mazda providing technology and Kia providing inexpensive manufacturing facilities for Ford Company. Available as both a 3-door soft-top convertible and 5-door SUV, it featured three Mazda-sourced engines in the Sportage, beginning with the 2.0-litre FE DOHC inline-four petrol unit producing 95 kW (128 hp) and the 2.0-litre RF inline-four diesel rated at 61 kW (82 hp). The 1997 model year Kia Sportage was the world's first production vehicle to be equipped with a knee airbag. The first generation was discontinued after 2002, with The Kia Sportage was not produced from 2003-2004.

- **Second Generation (2005-2010)**: After a two-year hiatus, the Sportage returned in model-year 2005, sharing a Hyundai Elantra-based platform with the first-generation Hyundai Tucson. The 2nd generation model was likely to favor the available V6 129 kW (173 hp), with 241 NÂ·m. Overall fit, finish, and quality were stunningly improved over the 1st generation model. In May 2008 a facelift model of the 2nd generation was introduced. This generation marked a shift from the original's off-road capability to a more car-like unibody design focused on on-road comfort and practicality.

- **Third Generation (2010-2016)**: The SL series Sportage was released to Asian and European markets in April 2010, the North and Central American markets in August 2010, and the Australian market in October 2010, for the 2011 model year. The third generation Sportage is notable for being a bit sportier than the newer generations. The Sportage's swept-back headlights give it an aggressive appearance, and under the hood, Kia offered a turbocharged engine with 260 horsepower to back up those looks, and the suspension was also suitably tuned for better handling. The third generation received a facelift for the 2014 model year that included a new grille with a redesigned Kia logo, LED tail lights and redesigned alloy wheels.

- **Fourth Generation (2016-2022)**: Kia unveiled its newly redesigned Sportage at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2015, and brought it to market in 2016 (as a 2017 model in North America). The Korean automaker benefited from the experience gathered with the previous generation and understood better what customers wanted. Thus, the new generation came to satisfy and even overcome buyers' expectations. Even though the new features offered by the automaker raised the vehicle's price, Kia's fourth iteration of this nameplate outsold its predecessor. This generation featured refined styling with the signature "Tiger Nose" grille and improved interior quality and technology features.

- **Fifth Generation (2021-present)**: After 28 years since the Sportage's first generation, Kia unveiled the fifth sequel of its compact SUV, with a version designed exclusively for the European market. The Sportage evolved a lot in its almost three decades from a small off-road vehicle fitted with a transfer case and low-range gear to a practical SUV that could cope better with the urban traffic than with tracks and roots. The fifth generation of the Kia Sportage dramatically improved the compact SUV by increasing cargo and interior space and adding the latest tech. The all-new Sportage improved on just about every aspect of the previous vehicle. Launched as a 2023 model year in North America, this generation introduced hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants alongside the standard gasoline engine. Kia released the facelift model of the fifth-generation Sportage on 5 November 2024 for the 2026 model year. Changes includes an updated front fascia with new headlights (replacing the prior boomerang headlights) and updated front bumper design, new LED graphics for the taillights, new exterior colours and new alloy wheel designs.
